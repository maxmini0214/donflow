## Title
Show HN: DonFlow – Plan vs. reality budget tracker, 100% browser-only

## Text
I built DonFlow to solve a personal pain point: I'd set up a monthly budget, then never check back because updating it was too annoying. Three months later, my plan and reality had completely diverged.

DonFlow is a browser-only budget planner that compares what you planned to spend vs. what you actually spent. No server, no signup, no tracking — all data stays in IndexedDB.

Key features:
- Plan vs. actual progress bars per category
- Drift warnings when spending exceeds plan
- What-if simulator for budget changes
- Smart CSV/XLSX import (auto-detects 14+ Korean card formats)
- Full JSON export/import for backup

Tech: React + TypeScript + Vite, Dexie.js, SheetJS, hosted on GitHub Pages.

Would love feedback on the UX and any feature ideas!

## Notes
- Need: demo GIF or screenshot in README before posting
- Timing: weekday morning US time (Tue-Thu 10am ET optimal for HN)
- Korean card format support is a differentiator but niche — lead with universal value
