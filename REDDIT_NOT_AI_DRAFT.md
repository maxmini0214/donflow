## Draft Comment

**DonFlow** — a browser-only budget planner that compares your plan vs. reality.

I kept building budget spreadsheets, then abandoning them 3 months later because updating them was tedious. DonFlow solves that specific loop: set a financial plan once, upload your bank/card exports, and it shows where reality drifts from your plan.

The key word is "plan vs. actual" — most budget apps just track what you spent (like a rearview mirror). DonFlow is more like a GPS that tells you when you're off course.

**Proudly not-AI:**
- 100% browser-only (IndexedDB, zero network requests)
- No signup, no account, no tracking
- Open DevTools and verify — nothing phones home
- Works offline after first load

## Notes
- Tone: genuine, not salesy. The thread explicitly invites self-promotion so it's OK to share.
- Focus on the "not-AI" angle since that's the thread's theme.
- "Open DevTools and verify" — this resonated on HN in similar threads.
- Keep short — Reddit comments that are too long get skipped.
- **max approval needed before posting.**
