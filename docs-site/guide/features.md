## Plan vs. Reality Dashboard

Most budget apps track what you **spent**. DonFlow tracks what you **planned** — and shows you where reality diverges.

Each category shows a progress bar comparing your budget allocation against actual spending. At a glance, you know:

- ✅ Categories on track
- ⚠️ Categories approaching their limit
- 🔴 Categories that have exceeded their budget

### Drift Warnings

When spending exceeds your plan, DonFlow alerts you immediately. No manual formula checking. No end-of-month surprises.

## What-If Simulator

Before making budget changes, test them:

> "What if I cut dining out by 30%?"
> "What if I increase my savings allocation?"
> "What happens if rent goes up next month?"

The simulator shows the cascading impact across your entire budget — before you commit to any changes.

## Smart CSV/XLSX Import

Upload bank statements or card transaction exports. DonFlow handles the rest:

- **Auto-column detection** — No need to manually map "date", "amount", "description"
- **14+ statement formats** — KB, Shinhan, Woori, Hana, NH, and international banks
- **Multi-currency** — `$`, `€`, `£`, `¥`, `₩` amounts parsed correctly
- **Accounting formats** — Handles parenthetical negatives like `(1,234.56)`
- **Powered by SheetJS** — Runs entirely in your browser. Files never leave your machine.

## Custom Categories

Organize your budget with emoji-labeled categories and flexible grouping:

- 🍕 **Dining Out** — restaurants, delivery, cafés
- 🏠 **Housing** — rent, utilities, maintenance
- 🚇 **Transport** — subway, bus, taxi, fuel
- 💊 **Health** — insurance, pharmacy, gym

Create, edit, reorder — it's your structure.

## Data Portability

Your data is yours. Always.

- **JSON Export** — Full backup with one click. Human-readable, well-structured.
- **CSV Export** — Transaction history in plain CSV. Import into Excel, Sheets, or any tool.
- **No vendor lock-in** — Standard formats only. No proprietary schema. Walk away anytime.
- **Works offline** — Once loaded, DonFlow works without internet. Your budget doesn't need WiFi.
